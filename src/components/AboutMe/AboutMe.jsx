                Full stack web developer specializing in MERN stack development. Creating an elegant user experience and user interface is my passion, yet I still enjoy the connection of the back end and front end. For the past 2 years, I have been working as a full stack developer focusing on the front end side of the application. As a developer, I find my strengths are in my eye for design and the flow of a website.
                <br/>
                I have a deep passion for coding and enjoy it every single day. I love completing websites, as well as completing other developement projects of my own. I am a hard worker, overachiever, and a reliable source for any help you may need. I may not have the work experience that other coders possess but I assure you that I am motivated and hungry to create some outstanding web pages, I would love to show you what I can do!

                <br/><br/>
                Thank you for your time,<br/>
